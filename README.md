PyLox
=====

This is a python implementation of jlox from [CraftingInterpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com).

This implementation:

* Attempts to closely mirror Java syntax, rather than be fully Pythonic.
* Use types on all objects and verify correctness with mypy.
* Lox test files copied from https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/test
* pytest used to run tests
